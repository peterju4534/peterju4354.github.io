## Introduction

This project is to document the dreams that I have that I can recall. This project was done purely out of self-interest and the interest to the topic **dreams** and other topics that possibly relates to it.

This project may stop at any time due to any unforeseen reasons; one most possible reason is that I find this not interesting anymore.
